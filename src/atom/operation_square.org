* Binary Operations Upon Simplex Primitives.

** Operations Upon Various Atomic Types 
|         | SString     | Symbol      | Number      |
| SString | SString     | SExpression | SExpression |
| Symbol  | SExpression | SExpression | SExpression |
| Number  | SExpression | SExpression | Number      |

** Note
   Evaluation and replacement of symbolic variables should be delayed until after said operations are done,
   this makes our primitive library much, much simpler to think about, as we do not have to have multiple
   return types (requiring the use of templates possibly)
   
** Explanation
   The way this should be done is in the case we are performing some internal function, for example add, 
   we would first do a replacement from the symbol table, after all our variables are replaced that can
   be, we run whatever operations (specifically plus, subtract, etc) we want and in the case that a 
   symbol or unmatching type is resulting, we can return an SExpression instead of an evaluation.
